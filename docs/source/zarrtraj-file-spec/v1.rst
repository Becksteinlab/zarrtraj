ZarrTraj Specification
=============================

The *ZarrTraj* trajectory file format is based on the streamable, compressible
`Zarr`_ file format.

`zarr`_ must be installed else a `RuntimeError` is raised.

Notation
^^^^^^^^

- ``(name)`` is a Zarr group
- ``{name}`` is a Zarr group with an arbitrary name
- ``[variable]`` is a Zarr array
- ``<dtype>`` is the Zarr array datatype
- ``+--`` is an attribute of a group or Zarr array

Additional Requirements
---------

* The zarrtraj file must contain at least one of positions, velocities, or forces.
* All included elements (positions, etc) must be sampled at every frame.
* Since Zarr doesn't allow linking arrays, only one step array and one time array should be included
  as a part of either positions, velocites, forces, or box/edges. The reader and writer must handle 
  identifying the step and time arrays present.
