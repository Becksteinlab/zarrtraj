Welcome to Zarrtraj's documentation!
====================================

Zarrtraj is a proof-of-concept for a new paradigm of trajectory storage and analysis in MDAnalysis 
by allowing users to store and read and write trajectory files in the H5MD format to and from the cloud.

This means users can interact with massive trajectory files without ever storing them on their own disk.
